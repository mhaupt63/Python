## Exercise 1

## 1.1 Define 2 vectors x_rand and y_rand, each contains 200 random
##     numbers from a uniform distribution, then generate a 
##     scatter plot out of x_rand and y_rand. Save this plot as 
##     'first_scatter_plot.html'.


## 1.2 Define 4 vectors x1, x2, y1 and y2, each contains 500 random
##     numbers from a uniform distribution, then generate a
##     scatter plot out of (x1, y1), (x2, y2). (x1, y1) should be grouped as 
##     'group 1' and coloured as green. (x2, y2) should be grouped as 'group 2'
##     and coloured as RGB(193, 66, 66) with a transparency of 0.8.
##     Then save the plot as 'second_scatter_plot.html'.

## 1.3 Define 3 vectors x, y_point and y_line. x has 200 elements which are
##     evenly distributed between 0 and 1 (i.e. the distance between 
##     consecutive elements in x is the same). y_point has 200 elements which 
##     are random numbers generated from a uniform distribution between 0 
##     and 1. y_line has 200 elements which are random numbers generated 
##     from a uniform distribution between -1 and -5. Generate a point chart
##     out of (x, y_point) (coloured in blue and labelled as 'dot'), 
##     and a line chart out of (x, y_line) (coloured in orange and labelled as
##     'line') together. Save the chart as 'third_scatter_plot.html'.
